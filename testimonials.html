    <li><q>Dominic did an excellent job tutoring my son in precalculus. 
        He was knowledgeable, reliable and personable. I really 
        appreciated how accommodating he was whenever my son requested 
        additional tutoring before a test. Everything about the 
        experience was positive.</q>

        <q>Dominic has had such an amazing impact on my life over the 
        last year. The first time we met, it was the day his daughter 
        was born! That's true dedication to his students, and he 
        hadn't even met me yet. Since then, not only have I LEARNED 
        math, but I've started to understand WHY math works the way it
         does. We can converse about anything - math or non math aligned
          - and he knows all about it. There is never a question that goes
           unanswered when he is around. Dominic loves math, and his 
           passion has spread into mine, taking me from someone who 
           thought of a number as just another button on a calculator 
           to someone who sees the world mathematically. To top all of 
           this off, he has really cute cats :)</q>

        <q>Dominic has provided weekly online tutoring for our sons in 
        algebra, geometry and calculus.  He is an energetic and engaging 
        tutor. Our oldest scored a 5 on his AP Calculus exam and credits 
        working with Dominic as the reason “Hands down the best math 
        teacher I’ve ever had. He just loves math.”  Dominic is just as 
        effective teaching lower level math classes.  We have had such a 
        positive experience with Dominic that we were delighted to 
        discover that Katherine was available for chemistry tutoring. 
        Katherine is knowledgeable and patient. As a parent, I have also 
        appreciated her insights, partnership and adjustments to make 
        sure our son is making progress. Dominic and Katherine are 
        incredibly responsive on scheduling — just an overall positive 
        experience!</q>

        <q>My son was taking honors math, and after a rather poor start of 
        the semester, he needed help. Dominic thoroughly reviewed the 
        material with him, and explained the topics that my son had 
        struggled with. Dominic provided different methods to solve 
        problems, and tips on how to remember them. All this really 
        helped my son, and he finished the semester much better than he 
        started. In addition, Dominic is responsive and he responds 
        promptly to my e-mails.</q>

        Dominic was an outstanding math tutor that guided me through 
        Calculus AB. With prior experience in math, Dominic showed me 
        different learning methods that helped my math skills along with 
        various examples. Additionally, Dominic provided excellent AP 
        test material that helped me earn college credit. My favorite 
        part about Dominic is that he not only helps you with math but 
        also values the relationship between tutor and student.</q>

        I would highly recommend Dominic Lipari for any tutoring services 
        regarding math. He is approachable, patient, and honest that at 
        times even he doesn't know everything. He's willing to at times be 
        flexible and is understanding about if you make mistakes or have 
        trouble processing things. I found him to be a very good tutor and 
        I wouldn't have been able to do well in my classes without him.</q>
