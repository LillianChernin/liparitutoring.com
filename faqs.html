            <p class="question">Q: Can I reschedule my appointment or add additional appointments if 
              there’s an upcoming quiz or test?</p>
            <p class="answer">A: Of course! We always try to make adjustments to our schedule in order 
              to accommodate the most immediate needs of our students. Though we cannot always guarantee 
              there will be available spots, we will always see if there’s a way.</p>

            <p class="question">Q: Can I just schedule appointments whenever I need help, rather than set up 
              recurring appointments?</p>
            <p class="answer">A: Yes. The benefits of recurring appointments are substantial (improved working 
              relationship between tutor and student, a greater ability to tailor our tutoring to the particular 
              student), so we always encourage regular weekly meetings. However, we understand that not everyone is 
              in the position to meet weekly and we are happy to fit students in as needed if we are available.</p>

            <p class="question">Q: Do you do in-person tutoring?</p>

              students either at a library or in our home. Contact us for availability.</p>

            <p class="question">Q: What is your cancellation policy?</p>
            <p class="answer">A: We have a strict <b>24 hour</b> cancellation policy if an appointment needs 
              to either canceled or rescheduled. We appreciate your understanding given that tutoring is our 
              primary means of earning money for our family.</p>
