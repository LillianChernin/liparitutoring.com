      <h2>Dominic</h2>
      <p>Dominic’s interest in math originally led him to pursue an 
        engineering degree at UC Berkeley, where he would often tutor 
        friends in their math and science classes. After four years 
        of school and a year working as an engineer, he came to two 
        conclusions that led to a career change: 1) he enjoyed the 
        math on its own more than its applications to engineering, 
        and 2) he loved helping others find delight in discovering the 
        beauty and order in math. Dominic has been a high school math 
        teacher in Oakland public schools for the past 10 years, and 
        has tutored both in person and virtually since even before 
        that. He loves asking the right questions to help students 
        solidify their conceptual understanding of the material, and 
        making up problems that stretch students’ ability to apply new 
        ideas. Most of all he loves the fun of doing math 
        collaboratively, trading solution paths and building on one 
        another’s ideas. When not teaching and doing math, Dominic can 
        be found playing with his four children at a park, practicing 
        his guitar, or expanding his extensive music library.</p>
