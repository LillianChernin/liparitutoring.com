        <p class="bioText">Dominic’s interest in math originally led him to pursue an 
        engineering degree at UC Berkeley, where he would often tutor 
        friends in their math and science classes. After four years 
        of school and a year working as an engineer, he came to two 
        conclusions that led to a career change: 1) he enjoyed the 
        math on its own more than its applications to engineering, 
        and 2) he loved helping others find delight in discovering the 
        beauty and order in math. Dominic has been a high school math 
        teacher in Oakland public schools for the past 10 years, and 
        has tutored both in person and virtually since even before 
        that. He loves asking the right questions to help students 
        solidify their conceptual understanding of the material, and 
        making up problems that stretch students’ ability to apply new 
        ideas. Most of all he loves the fun of doing math 
        collaboratively, trading solution paths and building on one 
        another’s ideas. When not teaching and doing math, Dominic can 
        be found playing with his four children at a park, practicing 
        his guitar, or expanding his extensive music library.</p>

          <p class="bioText"> While earning my Biology BS at UT Austin I loved getting to 
          wake up early on a Saturday to tutor organic chemistry at the 
          university learning center. While working as a researcher during 
          my bachelor’s and after I loved working with new students in 
          the lab, training them on research techniques and safety. While 
          in graduate school at UC Berkeley I took in an unacceptably 
          large number of undergraduates to train in lab techniques. I 
          enjoyed bringing fruit flies to the local middle school to teach 
          kids genetics. I loved working as a TA throughout graduate school 
          - earning a university-wide award for teaching - and unsurprisingly 
          after getting my PhD in cell and molecular biology became a lecturer.
          Getting students to think like scientists is always my goal - in 
          the class, and while tutoring children and adults. True 
          experimentalist thinking is a combination of rigorous habits and 
          language, as well as the development of a ‘scientific intuition’. 
          Themes exist from the simplest chemistry to the most complex 
          biological systems: how electrons flow during reactions, how 
          macromolecules interact, how system-wide signaling impacts physiology.
